Massive shoutout to Solybum and HybridEidolon who've both contributed to this addon and corrected the mistakes I've made along the way.

Installation Instructions:

2. If PSO is already running - press 'Reload'
3. Configure the plugin through the in-game configuration window located at Main > XpBar
